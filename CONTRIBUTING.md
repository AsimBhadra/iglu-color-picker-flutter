# Contributing to IGLU Color Picker Flutter

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

This project is opinionated and follows patterns and practices used by the team at [IGLU][iglu_link].

## Creating a Bug Report

We highly recommend [creating an issue][bug_report_link] if you have found a bug rather than immediately opening a pull request. This lets us reach an agreement on a fix before you put significant effort into a pull request. Once one of the package maintainers has reviewed the issue and an agreement is reached regarding the fix, a pull request can be created.

## Creating a Pull Request

Before creating a pull request please:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
1. Install all dependencies (`dart pub get`).
1. Squash your commits and ensure you have a meaningful, [semantic][conventional_commits_link] commit message.
2. Format your code (`dart format .`).
3. Analyze your code (`dart analyze --fatal-infos --fatal-warnings .`).
4. Create the Pull Request.
5. Verify that all status checks are passing.

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your
pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional
work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately
accepted.
